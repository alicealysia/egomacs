Based on Visual Emacs, Egomacs pushes the idea of making emacs into a modern editor far, far further than its contemporaries.

the main drawcards are:
- a mouse driven UI
- closing tabs works like you would expect it to (kill buffer, close window if last
- more vscode style shortcuts than ever before.
- extensive LSP support

I'll likely be pushing forwards with quite a few updates over time, and to be fair, this isn't exactly a clean and tidy config. Rather it would be better to say it's a dogs breakfast. So far I've included many of my favourite VSCode shortcuts, and several packages designed to make things work a bit more like they do in it and editors like it.

I can't exactly say why I put so much effort into this... but I did. There's still a few things I'm experimenting with. The biggest of these is the idea of finding some way to enable dragging and dropping tabs. I've seen this done precisely once before, and it was a fairly crude implementation.

That being said, David Shepherd's frames only mode could be the key...
